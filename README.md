#Challenge To Mola Corban

### I tried resolve the second problem (Conference Track Management)

#### somethings about my solution, I tried separate the things in style of a real world application. I assumed that Conference, Sessions, Talks are entities. I tried to put the classes in yours layers.
                                                                                                         
* To run the app, you can do:
    * replace the '*' for the number of talk file in resources
    
```shell script
php public/index.php resources/task*.text
```

* To run my easy CLI, just do: 

```shell script
./easy.sh -h
```
